\section{Discussion}
\label{ch:discuss}

Summarize what has been shown in the dissertation and point towards future research. Indicate challenges and areas of promise. 

\begin{itemize}
\item The necessity of variable selection in decision trees. 
\item The pruning rule is not enough
\item Bootstrapping has it's drawbacks. 
\item DiVaS a method to handle Variable selection in Bayesian decision trees
\item Limitations of DiVaS, ad-hoc nature etc. 
\item ALoVaS method, conceptually a generic method tailored to your specific prior.
\item Areas of future research needed in decision trees: Alternative terminal node models, more variable selection, and theoretical properties of Bayesian decision trees.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item Zero-inflated (ZI) Bayesian decision trees (Bayes CART style)
\item ZI Poisson and Negative Binomial trees compared to Greedy algorithms for ZI tree models. 
\item Case study 1: Solder data 
\item Case study 2: Nematode data 
\item Case study 3: subterranean grapevine root intercept counts
\item Tying it together: ZI Poisson and Negative Binomial methods with variable selection methods
\item The first order equivalence of the lasso, horseshoe, generalized double pareto and other Bayesian penalty shrinkage-selection priors. 
\end{itemize}
