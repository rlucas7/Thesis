\begin{abstract}
In this thesis proposal we provide a historical survey of the statistics and computer science research in decision trees. We review both the greedy and Bayesian approaches to decision tree induction and propose a novel modification to previous Bayesian decision tree methods. Our approach facilitates covariate selection explicitly in the model, something not present in most previous research. Covariate selection is facilitated by a transform, which we define,  that allows us to use priors from linear models. Using this transform, we are able to modify many common approaches to variable selection in the linear model and bring these methods to bear on the problem of explicit covariate selection in decision tree models. We also provide theoretical guidelines, including a theorem, which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency of decision trees in infinite dimensional spaces. Our examples and case studies use both simulated and real data cases with moderate to large numbers of covariates. The examples give support to the claim that, in large dimensional covariate datasets, if decision tree methods are to be applied, the approach presented here is to be preferred.   

%The thesis proposal is a type of contract between the faculty and the student. 
%An accepted thesis proposal indicates that the work proposed by the student, 
%once completed, will be accepted by the faculty as sufficiently innovative and 
%substantial as to be recognized with the award of the degree. It is part of 
%the training of the student's research apprenticeship that the form of this 
%proposal must be as concise as those proposals required by major funding 
%agencies.

\section{Discussion}
\label{ch:discuss}

Summarize what has been shown in the dissertation and point towards future research. Indicate challenges and areas of promise. 

\begin{itemize}
\item The necessity of variable selection in decision trees. 
\item The pruning rule is not enough
\item Bootstrapping has it's drawbacks. 
\item DiVaS a method to handle Variable selection in Bayesian decision trees
\item Limitations of DiVaS, ad-hoc nature etc. 
\item ALoVaS method, conceptually a generic method tailored to your specific prior.
\item Areas of future research needed in decision trees: Alternative terminal node models, more variable selection, and theoretical properties of Bayesian decision trees.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item Zero-inflated (ZI) Bayesian decision trees (Bayes CART style)
\item ZI Poisson and Negative Binomial trees compared to Greedy algorithms for ZI tree models. 
\item Case study 1: Solder data 
\item Case study 2: Nematode data 
\item Case study 3: subterranean grapevine root intercept counts
\item Tying it together: ZI Poisson and Negative Binomial methods with variable selection methods
\item The first order equivalence of the lasso, horseshoe, generalized double pareto and other Bayesian penalty shrinkage-selection priors. 
\end{itemize}
